# Neural-Network-form-Scratch
This project implements a neural network from scratch in Python (no deep learning libraries) to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.
It includes:
 - Custom implementations of layers, activations, optimizers, and loss functions
 - Support for batch training and various optimizers (SGD, Momentum, Adam)
 - Visualization of training loss, prediction distributions, scatter plots, and confusion matrix
